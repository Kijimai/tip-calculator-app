## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS Flexbox/Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned so many ways to manipulate the DOM based on the eventlistener's outcome and even learned newer ways of targetting parent elements and close elements. 
I did not end up using some of them but it was a great way to learn about these specific method's existence. 
The app was certainly a great challenged to learn from, and I plan to redo a similar app at some time in the future.
